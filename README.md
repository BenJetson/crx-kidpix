JS Kid Pix / Kid Pix 1.0 was released in to the public domain and this is an HTML/JS reimplementation.

### Guide
Just like the original Kid Pix, there's no guide. Have fun!  Most of the tools support Shift (^) to enlarge the tool. There are a handful of hidden features behind various modifier keys (⌘, ⌥, ⇧) for some of the tools. The modifier keys can also be combined. Enjoy! :) 

### TODO
* If anyone has any idea what the original Kid Pix "3-d" brush is doing with the dithering, drop me a note. I couldn't intuit it :(

* A few animations and sounds still need to be filled in.
* Safari/iOS sounds need pre-loading.
